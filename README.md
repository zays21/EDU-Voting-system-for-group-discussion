# Voting System for Group Decision

## Project Title
Voting System for Group Decision

## Project Description
This project implements a decentralized voting system using a Solidity smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows a group of registered voters to cast votes on predefined proposals, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability. The system is managed by an admin who can start/end the voting process and register voters, while voters can cast a single vote for their preferred proposal.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to create a secure and trustless voting mechanism for group decision-making. By leveraging blockchain technology, the system ensures that votes are tamper-proof, verifiable, and accessible to all participants. This can be applied to small-scale group decisions, such as community governance, team project choices, or organizational polls, with the potential to scale for broader use cases.

## Future Scope
- **Multi-group Support**: Extend the contract to support multiple voting groups or sessions simultaneously.
- **Voter Anonymity**: Integrate zero-knowledge proofs to enhance voter privacy.
- **Time-based Voting**: Add time constraints for voting periods using block timestamps.
- **Token-based Voting**: Introduce a governance token to weight votes based on token ownership.
- **UI Integration**: Develop a user-friendly front-end interface for interacting with the contract.

## Key Features
- **Admin Control**: An admin can initialize proposals, register voters, and start/end the voting process.
- **Single Vote per Voter**: Ensures fairness by restricting voters to one vote each.
- **Transparency**: All votes and results are stored on the blockchain, publicly verifiable.
- **Proposal Management**: Supports multiple proposals with vote counting and winner determination.
- **Event Logging**: Emits events for key actions (e.g., vote casting, voting start/end) for real-time tracking.
